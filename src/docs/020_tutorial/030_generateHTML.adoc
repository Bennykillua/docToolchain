== generateHTML & generatePDF

The xref:../015_tasks/03_task_generateHTML.adoc[`generateHTML`] and xref:../015_tasks/03_task_generatePDF.adoc[`generatePDF`] tasks are the most basic tasks which just invoke asciidoctor to generate the output you want.

The output is written to `build/html5/arc42/arc42.html` and `build/pdf/arc42/Arc42.pdf`.

[[html_out]]
.generated output of generateHTML task
image::generateHTML.dio.png[]

As you can see in <<html_out>>, the HTML output is rendered as a single page with a table of contents (TOC) on the left.
If you have chosen the `withhelp` version, you will notice some little question marks on the right.
Hover over these with your mouse and you will see the full help text for each paragraph.
This way, you can leave these help texts in your docs without annoying your readers.

[[pdf_out]]
.generated output of generatePDF task
image::generatePDF.png[]

<<pdf_out>> shows you the generated PDF.
It also contains a TOC on the first pages and your PDF reader will also show the TOC on the left for you to navigate through the document.

Both, the HTML and PDF output can be styled to fit your needs.

=== Configuration

==== Files to convert

For both tasks, the most important configuration is the `inputFiles`-list at the start of your `docToolchainConfig.groovy`

[source, groovy]
----
inputFiles = [
        //[file: 'doctoolchain_demo.adoc',       formats: ['html','pdf']],
        //[file: 'arc42-template.adoc',    formats: ['html','pdf']],
        /** inputFiles **/
]
----

Normally, Asciidoctor converts all files it can find.
But when you structure your documents with includes, you don't want each and every chapter to be converted in its own pdf.
So, you need a main AsciiDoc file which includes all chapters in order to create a full document.

The `inputFiles`-map provides a list of all these main files and a list of formats for which the file should be used.
This way, you can specify that certain files should be converted to HTML but not to PDF for example.

You need to configure this list manually.
So if docToolchain converts an unexpected list of files, this is the first location where you should look for a problem.

==== PDF Style

To get started, you should execute `./dtcw copyTheme` in order to copy a simple `pdfTheme` to your own project.
You will find it in `/src/docs/pdfTheme`.

Currently, docToolchain uses the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] library.
The documentation contains a good https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/v1.6.0/docs/theming-guide.adoc[theming guide].

To activate the new style, you have to tell asciidoctor where to find it.
For maximum flexibility, you specify the location and other pdf related attributes in the file you want to convert.

The most important ones are

[source, asciidoc]
----
:pdf-stylesdir: ../pdfTheme
:pdf-style: custom
// only needed when you specify your own fonts
:pdf-fontsdir: ../pdfTheme/fonts
----

For this tutorial, navigate to `src/docs/arc42/arc42.adoc and add

[source, asciidoc]
----
:pdf-stylesdir: ../pdfTheme
:pdf-style: custom
----

to the top of the document.
This will specify that asciidoc will find the the pdfTheme relative to the document location in `../pdfTheme` which will result in `src/docs/arc42/../pdfTheme` which is equal to `src/docs/pdfTheme`.

You can also make use of the attribute `\{projectRootDir}` which will contain the absolute path to your project directory.
So, `:pdf-stylesdir: \{projectRootDir}/src/docs/pdfTheme` will search in my case in `**/home/rdmueller/projects/demo**/src/docs/pdfTheme` for the theme.

NOTE: in order to use the `\{projectRootDir}` also in your editor preview, define is as relative path, only if it is not already defined:

[source, asciidoc]
----
ifndef:projectRootDir[:projectRootDir: ../../..]
----

This example, added to the top of your `arc42.adoc` tutorial file, will set the `projectRootDir` to the correct folder.

==== HTML Style

The easiest way to modify the HTML style is to add a https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/pass/pass-block/[pass-through block] with the needed CSS styles.

[source, asciidoctor]
----
++++
<style>
  h2 {
    color: green;
  }
</style>
++++
----

NOTE: for the `generate**Site**` task, there is a different mechanism to change the styles if the generated microsite.
