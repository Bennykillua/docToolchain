== Diagrams: Diagrams.net

There is no `exportDiagramsnet` or `exportDrawio` task, because working with these diagrams is more convenient than with the other diagramming tools.

https://app.diagrams.net/[Diagrams.net] (formerly known as Draw.io) is a neat little tool which is able to store the source of your diagrams in the meta-data of your `.png` or `.svg` files.
To recognize these files as diagrams.net files, give them the extension `myfile**.dio.png**` or `myfile**.dio.svg**`.

In IntelliJ, with the asciidoctor and diagrams.net plugin installed, type something like

[source, asciidoc]
----
image::mynewdiagram.dio.png[]
----

:experimental:

IntelliJ will show you that the file doesn't exist.

image::diagramsnet1.png[width=416]

Press kbd:[alt + shift + enter] to create the file.
IntelliJ will then launch a local copy of the diagrams.net editor.

Every change in the diagram will be directly reflected in your document.
