== Get the arc42 Template

To work with docToolchain, you first need some documents.
So let's fetch the https://arc42.org[arc42 template] for software architecture documentation.

docToolchain comes with a task called <<task_downloadTemplate,`downloadTemplate`>>.
Let's invoke it and see what happens.

.Linux / WSL2 with bash
[role='primary']
--
[source, bash]
----
./dtcw downloadTemplate
----

--

.Windows with Powershell
[role='secondary']
--
[source, powershell]
----
./dtcw.ps1 downloadTemplate
----
--

.Result of downloadTemplate-Task

Out of the box, docToolchain only knows the open source arc42 template for software architecture.
That's why it doesn't as which template to install.
Since the template exists in four different languages and with or without help on how to use it, docToolchain asks you for these two parameters.
It then downloads the template right from the source, unzips it and reformats it a little bit to fit docToolchain.

That's it.
You have now docToolchain with the arc42 template installed.
Let's render is as HTML, PDF or Microsite in the next steps.
