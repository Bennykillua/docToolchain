docToolchain provides you with some default themes which reside within docToolchain.
There are times where you want to overwrite these themes in your project.
In order to give you a good start, you can execute `copyThemes` and copy the pdfTheme or jBakeTheme to your project.
Feel free to remove all files which should remain as the default and change all other.
With the next run of docToolchain, it will lay your theme files over the default one in order to generate the PDF or site.
