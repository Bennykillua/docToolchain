== Who uses docToolchain?

include::../_feedback.adoc[]

docToolchain is used by many people.
Since the main focus of docToolchain is technical documentation, it is mainly used for internal projects not visible to the public.

Up until version 2.0.0, docToolchain had no static site generator and thus was used behind the scenes.
This has changed now and open source projects which use docToolchain start to be visible.
