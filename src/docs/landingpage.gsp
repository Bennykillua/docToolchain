                        Just kidding.
                        Since all your dev environments will already contain a git client, we didn't add another one.
                        Just use Git to create your Multi-Repository-Builds as explained in our tutorial.

                        To give you more power to do so, we've thrown in the well known twitter bootstrap to get you started.

                        docToolchain now contains jBake as Static Site Generator which lets you create documentation microsites for your projects.
                        This is such a huge feature that we have to explain it with some sub-features ðŸ˜€

                        We've "stolen" the great Docsy-Theme from hugo and made it the default theme for docToolchain.
                        Enjoy your docs with a nice and clear theme and easily customize it to make it your own!

                        If you want to, docToolchain automatically re-builds the site locally, whenever the sources change.
                        Quite convenient.
