When you use the build in static site generator through <<task_generatesite>>, you sometimes need a real static server locally running to preview the results.

This task will start a jetty with your generated site.

NOTE: Most site themes don't need the static site server.
You can just preview the site by opening it right from the filesystem in your browser.
