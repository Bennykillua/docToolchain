== About This Task

This task makes use of the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] plugin to render your documents as pretty PDF files.
Files are written to `build/pdf`.
The PDF is generated directly from your AsciiDoc sources. There is no need for an intermediate format or other tools.
The result looks more like a nicely rendered book than a print-to-PDF HTML page.

NOTE: The asciidoctor-pdf plugin is still in alpha status, but the results are already quite good.
If you want an alternative, use https://phantomjs.org/[PhantomJS] for your instance and script it.

== Creating a Custom PDF Theme

If you want to change colors, fonts or page headers and footers, you can do so by creating a `custom-theme.yml` file.
Copy the file `src/docs/pdfTheme/custom-theme.yml` from docToolchain to your project and reference it from your main `.adoc`file by setting the `:pdf-stylesdir:`.
For example, insert the following at the top of your document to reference `custom-theme.yml` from the `/pdfTheme` folder.

    :pdf-stylesdir: ../pdfTheme
