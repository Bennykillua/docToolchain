The next https://cyberland.ijug.eu/2021-12-open-source-camp/[Cyberland Open Source Camp] is just around the corner.
This time, https://doctoolchain.org[docToolchain] will be one of the featured open source projects for this event.

So, let's be prepared and think about what are realistic tasks which we could solve during those few ours.

Here are some handpicked issues from the https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/issues[list of open issues]:

* https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/issues/578[Autocompletion for the CLI]
* https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/issues/692[generateSite: additional navigation level on the left]
* https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/issues/699[create multi-branch github pages example]
* https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/issues/679[Investigations with Gitpod?]
* or even create a new https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/issues/700[InitRepo task]
