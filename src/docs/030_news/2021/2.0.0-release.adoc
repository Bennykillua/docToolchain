== v2.0.0 of docToolchain has been released!

Today docToolchain reached an important milestone - the release of version 2.0.0 aka ng or next-generation.

=== Which new features can you expect?

The most important change is the *switch to a command line based approach*.
You can now fully focus on your documentation without having lots of other files like scripts or themes in your repository.

This is possible through the introduction of the *docToolchain-wrapper* or short dtcw.
A little script which resides together with a config file in your repository.
It takes care that the right version of docToolchain is used, all pre-requisites are met, and it even checks if it should use docker or a local installation to execute docToolchain.
If docToolchain is not installed, it will install it for you.

Another change is that we tried very hard to *avoid error messages*.
Where we can't avoid errors, we tried to convert them to helpful hints.
This should make the use of docToolchain a better experience.

Another huge added feature is the `generateSite`-Task which includes https://jbake.org[jBake] as *static site generator* to help you even more to create awesome docs.
You can now create a full documentation website with less than a hand full commands.
And it even contains a *local search* implemented with https://lunrjs.com[lunr].

To get you started with your solution architecture documentation, we've added the `downloadTemplate`-task to provide you with the famous *arc42 template* in four languages.

Last but not least, we used the new `generateSite`-Feature to restructure the documentation of docToolchain itself.

The goal for the next weeks is now to provide you with tutorials over the next few weeks to demonstrate all features.

Happy writing!

Ralf
